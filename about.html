      <h4>Aparna Rao</h4>
      <p>I am a simple woman who believes in belief. As they say, belief can move mountains, and this may sound simplistic, it is still the 
      	common denomination separating those who live their dreams from those who live in regret. I'm an introvert. But, if you get along
      	I'll take you to the world inside of me.<br> 
      	My family is everything, and my friends are the greatest riches I have ever earned. India, my country, is what taught me what all
      	I'm today, and I'm proud of my country. I must say men in uniform are my ultimate love. 
      	Life itself is the most wonderful fairytale. Ever since my childhood, fairytales have been my companions. Growing up, I realized they were not my escape from reality, and rather, they were my reality. Like fairytale heroines, no magic would solve me unless I had the wit and heart with 
      	courage to use it widely. 
      	For me, art keeps me alive, and I believe imagination is the key. To me, it's all about nature, music, art, love, words, peace, and kindness. We all get worried about being pretty. So let's be pretty strong, pretty funny, and pretty kind.
